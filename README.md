## 🧭 1. Young’s Double Slit Experiment  

### 🔹 What It Shows
- This experiment shows that **light acts like a wave**.  
- When light passes through **two small slits**, it makes **bright and dark lines** on a screen.  
- These lines are called **interference fringes**.

---

### 🔹 How the Experiment Is Set
- A light source (like a small lamp or laser) shines on two small holes or slits, **S₁** and **S₂**.  
- The slits are very close to each other.  
- The light from the two slits falls on a **white screen** a little far away.  
- On the screen, we see **bright and dark lines** one after another.

### 🔹 What Happens
- The two lights from the slits **mix** or **interfere** with each other.  
- Where both lights meet in the **same wave**, we get a **bright line**.  
- Where they meet in **opposite waves**, they cancel each other and we get a **dark line**.

---

### 🔹 Formula for Bright Line Distance

Let,  
- `λ` = wavelength of light  
- `D` = distance from slits to screen  
- `d` = distance between two slits 

Then the **distance between two bright lines (fringe width)** is:

$$
\beta = \frac{\lambda\,D}{d}
$$


This means:  
- If we use **longer wavelength**, bright lines get **farther apart**.  
- If slits are **closer**, bright lines also go **farther apart**.

---

### 🔹 Uses
- To find the wavelength of light.  
- To show that light travels in waves.

## 🌕 2. Newton’s Rings  

### 🔹 What It Is
- When a **round glass lens** is placed on a **flat glass plate**, thin **air gap** forms between them.  
- Light reflects from both the top and bottom of the air layer.  
- This makes **round bright and dark rings** — called **Newton’s Rings**.

#### *Figure 2: Bright and dark circular rings formed by thin air layer.*

---

### 🔹 Why Rings Form
- The air layer between the glass pieces is **thicker at edges** and **thin in the middle**.  
- Light reflected from the top and bottom of this layer **interferes**.  
- So, some places become **bright** and some **dark**, forming rings.

---

### 🔹 To Find Wavelength of Light
1. Measure the **diameter of any two rings** (say 5th and 10th).  
2. Use the formula:  

$$
\lambda = \frac{D_{m+p}^2 - D_m^2}{4 R p}
$$

- R = radius of the lens  
- p = difference in ring numbers
3. Put the values and find the **wavelength**.

---

### 🔹 Uses
- To check if a glass surface is **flat or not**.  
- To find **wavelength** of light.  
- To find **refractive index** of a liquid.

## 🌊 3. Diffraction  

### 🔹 What Is Diffraction
- When light passes through a **small hole or edge**, it **bends** a little and **spreads out**.  
- This bending of light waves is called **diffraction**.

#### *Figure 4: Light waves bending and spreading after passing through a small slit.*

---

### 🔹 Two Types of Diffraction

| Type | What Happens | Example |
|------|---------------|----------|
| **Fresnel Diffraction** | Light source and screen are **close** to the obstacle. | Light around a pin or edge of a card. |
| **Fraunhofer Diffraction** | Light source and screen are **far** away, light rays are straight. | Light passing through a narrow slit with a lens. |

---

### 🔹 Examples in Daily Life
- Bending of light around **a door edge**.  
- **Rainbow colors** on CD or DVD surface.  
- **Edges of shadows** are not sharp due to diffraction.

---

## 🌈 4. Polarization & Brewster’s Law  

### 🔹 What Is Polarization
- Light waves normally **vibrate in many directions**.  
- When they vibrate in **only one direction**, it is called **polarized light**.  
- Polarization proves that **light is a transverse wave**.

#### *Figure 5: Unpolarized light turns into polarized light after passing through polarizer.*

---

### 🔹 Brewster’s Law
- When light hits a glass surface at a special angle called **Brewster’s angle (θᵦ)**,  
  the **reflected light becomes fully polarized**.  

The rule is:  

$$
\tan \theta_B = \mu
$$

- Here, μ = refractive index of the glass

- At this angle, the **reflected** and **refracted** rays are **at 90°** to each other.

#### *Figure 6: Light becomes polarized when reflected at Brewster’s angle.*

### 🔹 Polarimeter (To Measure Polarization)
- A **polarimeter** is a device used to measure how much a **substance turns** the direction of polarized light.

#### Main Parts:
1. **Light Source** – usually sodium lamp.  
2. **Polarizer** – makes light polarized.  
3. **Tube** – contains the liquid sample (like sugar water).  
4. **Analyzer** – helps to measure the turning angle.  

#### How It Works:
- Light becomes polarized and passes through the liquid.  
- The liquid turns the light’s direction a little.  
- The analyzer is turned until the brightness matches again.  
- The amount of turning shows the **optical rotation**.

## 🧩 Summary  

| Topic | Main Idea |
|--------|------------|
| **Young’s Double Slit** | Shows light acts like a wave and makes bright-dark lines. |
| **Newton’s Rings** | Circular bright-dark rings from thin air layer between glasses. |
| **Diffraction** | Light bends around edges or small holes. |
| **Polarization** | Light waves move in one plane only; Brewster’s angle gives full polarization. |
